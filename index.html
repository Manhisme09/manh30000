                 <h2>Levi Ackerman</h2>
                <p>Levi has short, straight black hair styled in an undercut curtain,
                     as well as narrow, intimidating dull gray eyes with dark circles 
                     under them and a deceptively youthful face. He is quite short,
                      but his physique is well-developed in musculature from extensive
                       vertical maneuvering equipment usage. He is usually either frowning
                        or expressionless; that, plus his extremely calm demeanor, 
                    often makes it difficult for others to guess what he is thinking.
                    He is most often seen in his Survey Corps uniform, with a light gray
                     button-up shirt underneath along with his trademark white ascot. When 
                     embarking on expeditions outside the Walls, he also wears the Survey 
                     Corps' green hooded cloak. Once, when forced to take leave from his 
                     duties due to injury, Levi was seen in a black suit, plain white shirt
                     , ascot, and dress shoes.[citation needed] However, since the beginning
                      of the coup d'état, he has left the ascot off. For most of the time 
                      during which the Survey Corps was on the run from the military and monarchy,
                     he simply wore his vertical maneuvering equipment harness over casual.
